# Hopf Fibration Visualizer

Welcome to the Hopf Fibration Visualizer! This website allows you to explore and visualize the Hopf Fibration, a fundamental concept in topology and differential geometry.

## About the Hopf Fibration

The Hopf Fibration, discovered as the first example of a map from a higher-dimensional sphere to a lower-dimensional sphere that is not null-homotopic, was a groundbreaking revelation in mathematics. Contrary to the prevailing belief at the time, the Hopf Fibration demonstrated that such mappings exist, challenging the analogy with homology groups.

The Hopf map $ f: S^3 \rightarrow S^2 $ arises in various contexts and can be generalized to a map $ S^7 \rightarrow S^4 $. For any point $ p $ in the sphere $ S^2 $, its preimage $ f^{-1}(p) $ is a circle $ S^1 $ in $ S^3 $. Descriptions of the Hopf map, also known as the Hopf fibration, abound.

## Mathematical Representation

The 3-sphere, $ S^3 $, defined as a submanifold of $ \mathbb{R}^4 $, and the 2-sphere, $ S^2 $, a submanifold of $ \mathbb{R}^3 $, are mathematically represented as:

$ S^3 = \{(X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4) : X_1^2 + X_2^2 + X_3^2 + X_4^2 = 1\} $

$ S^2 = \{(x_1, x_2, x_3) : x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 = 1\} $

The Hopf map transforms points $ (X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4) $ on $ S^3 $ to points $ (x_1, x_2, x_3) $ on $ S^2 $ according to the equations:

$ x_1 = 2(X_1X_2 + X_3X_4) $
$ x_2 = 2(X_1X_4 - X_2X_3) $
$ x_3 = X_1^2 + X_3^2 - X_2^2 - X_4^2 $
